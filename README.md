# cache-sim

One level cache simulator.

## How to run:
Navigate to the cloned directory and run ```./cache.py```

## Work to be done:

- [x] Implementing Cache.h header file. 
- [x] Testing Cache.h header file.
- [x] Implementing cache replacement algorithms.
- [x] Testing cache replacement algorithms.
- [x] Python/Shell script to run the simulator.
- [x] Implementing and testing the matrix multiplication programs.
- [x] Analysis of first 4 points (Phase I - Easy)
- [ ] Analysis of last 2 points (Phase II - Hard)

## Note: 

```src``` repository contains the C++ code for the simulators. ```exe``` repository will contain the executables generated while running the program.

```cache.h``` contains definition of CacheLine and Cache class.```cache.cpp``` file will contain the implementation of classes in ```cache.h```.

Traces for the 3 programs in ```/matrix``` can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JsXtNrd9Myawke7c2M9BEU8nSjW3ATSR)
