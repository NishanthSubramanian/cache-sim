# cache-sim

One level cache simulator.

## Work to be done :

- [x] Implementing Cache.h header file. 
- [ ] Testing Cache.h header file.
- [x] Implementing cache replacement algorithms.
- [ ] Testing cache replacement algorithms.
- [x] Python/Shell script to run the simulator.
- [ ] Implementing and testing the matrix multiplication programs.
- [ ] Analysis of first 4 points (Phase I - Easy)
- [ ] Analysis of last 2 points (Phase II - Hard)

## Note: 

```src``` repository contains the C++ code for the simulators and ```exe``` resository contains their executables.

```cache.h``` contains definition of CacheLine and Cache class. Look  through it and comment in the group if something is missing.

```cache.cpp``` file will contain the implementation of classes in ```cache.h```.
